Front end Test
The goal for this test is to evaluate HTML and CSS skills. 

Please check the Figma file provided. 

The file consists of a small page containing 3 main sections: banner, large tile and 3 cards.  The task is to reproduce this Figma design in HTML and CSS (you may also use Sass or Scss if preferred).
Breakpoints included are 360px for mobile, 768px for Tablet and 1160px+ for desktop, but it would be a plus if all viewports in between also keep a good appearance.

You must use the fonts and images provided in the Drive folder (link here).

You can build this page with the approach you consider more appropriate.

The test can be submitted through a link to a repository, .zip file or any other similar means and you may take up to 7 working days to deliver the test.

Note: the use of semantic HTML and proper alt info is a plus.
